//learning is easy just be aware of the flow and you good to go...

// javaScript dosnot have any relation with the JAVA its just at the 
// time js was invented that time java was popular and there makers thought it
//  will be grate marketing move if we named it as javaScript to make it popular as java

//JS elimenates spaces in between the code 
//It was dynamically typed language so veriable declaration doest need to wrote type 

//java script is most popular programming language 
//easy to learn to those who want to learn

//it also called as browser's lang cause it run's over the browser but after "node" it is mainly runs everyewhere from frontend to backend 


// js have 7 datatype: 

let intValue = 1;                                console.log(typeof intValue);
let stringValue = "Abhishek";                    console.log(typeof stringValue);
let BigIntValue = 789465132568974651256623n;     console.log(typeof BigIntValue);
let BooleanValue = true;                         console.log(typeof BooleanValue);  //boolean represent's ; 0 = false; 1 = true;
let charValue = "a";                             console.log(typeof charValue);
let nullValue = null;                            console.log(typeof nullValue);
let sybolValue = undefined;                      console.log(typeof aValue);

// javascript is case sensetive origramming language it means:

let Abhi = 123;
let abhi = 13; //both are different from each other lets print them:

console.log(Abhi);
console.log(abhi);

// JS is mainly using the CameCasing to write the code 

// Prefix (++variable or --variable): The variable is modified (incremented or decremented) before being used in the expression.
// Postfix (variable++ or variable--): The variable is used in the expression first, and then it is modified (incremented or decremented).
// Use Cases:
// Prefix: Useful when you want to immediately use the updated value.
// Postfix: Useful when you need to use the current value before it changes.




// there are main two type of datatype 1== primitive (call by value) && 2== non-primitive (referance type)
// 1== primitive (call by value) : 7 type of data type as we seen above 

// 2== non-primitive (referance type) : Array , Object , Functions


//array 

const hero = ["shaktiman", "shakalaka", "juniyar-G"]
console.log(hero);

// object

let obj = {
    name : "abhishek",
    age : 24
}
console.log(obj)

// Function

const myfunction = function(){
    console.log("dare to learn")

}

myfunction() // its how you run the function ;)
